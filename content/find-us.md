# How to find us

## From Glasgow

The A82 will take you alongside Loch Lomond to Crianlarich. Turn left there and continue through Tyndrum and Glen Coe and onwards to Fort William. Continue to Spean Bridge and on to Invergarry. There you should turn left towards Kyle of Lochalsh. This road ends at a junction where you should turn left until you reach Shiel Bridge. Here is where you turn left over the small bridge and over the hill to Glenelg.

## From Inverness

The A82 will take you to Invermoriston where you turn right onto the A887. Continue until you reach Shiel Bridge. Here you will turn left over the small bridge and over the hill to Glenelg.

## Over the hill

A mountain pass, constructed in 1815, leads from Shiel Bridge to Glenelg. From sea level it twists and turns towards the summit of Mam Ratagan before making a more gradual descent. 30 minutes for the journey from Shiel Bridge to the ferry should be sufficient.

You can find out more about Glenelg and the area that surrounds it on [the local information site, whats-there.co.uk](http://www.whats-there.co.uk).

## Service Dates

We run annually from Easter until October. The precise dates are changeable due to Easter being a moveable feast and October can throw up some tricky conditions with weather.
We will keep the site updated as to when we open and close for the season each year.

## Times of service

Seven days a week between 10am and 6pm (10am to 7pm June, July, August). Every 20 minutes or as required.

## Weather Closure

Bad weather can occasionally affect the service. Signs are posted at each of the junctions to access the ferry indicating closure if necessary. The facebook page and site are updated also. If weather conditions are tricky, please check before travel.

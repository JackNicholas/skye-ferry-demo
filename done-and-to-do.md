done and to do
==============

## to do

* check typefaces for strapline and title - currently using google near-equivalents:
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;

Can we leave out the 'community-owned' phrase.
It causes more problems than it solves for us.
Perhaps the heading should be as on merchandise "The Original Glenelg-Skye Ferry"
Other than that - looking good thus far - thanks guys


## done

* changed blue of title to that of kid's t-shirt image. #100B60 - is this right?
* logotype and top menu
* add favicons
* add twitter feed
* basic homepage layout
